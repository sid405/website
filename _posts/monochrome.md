I've been giving monochrome themes a try on VSCode. I don't quite remember where I saw it first, but for some reason I associate them with [tj](https://github.com/tj), so I guess they'll get credit for it!

### Why?

IDK man, it just looks so slick! Isn't that what editor themes are all about anyway? I don't think I've ever used editor token colors for anything. Here's what my editor looks like right this second:

The theme I'm using is (aptly) called [Monochrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anotherglitchinthematrix.monochrome) (I'm using the `Monochrome Dark` variant). I also like to run a fairly minimal editor setup, so I think this is right up my alley. Not sure how long I'll stick with this, but this theme has been on for about a week now, and that's usually the threshold for me; anything that lasts that long usually stays for good!
